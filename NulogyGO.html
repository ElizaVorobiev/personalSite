                <p >Nulogy delivers cloud based solutions to Consumer Packaged Good (CPG) Brands and their suppliers to help them reduce costs and waste in their supply chain process. Contract packagers (co-packers) are often hired by CPG companies to produce promotional orders.  Co-packers receive base products from CPG companies and then package the products based on the specifications provided by the CPG marketing team. Due to the short life span and high customization of promotional orders co-packers must deal with complex orders in a very efficient and timely manner. Nulogy produces cloud-based software to help CPG companies and their co-packers to improve their performance. Companies use Nulogy products to increase the percentage of on time and in full (OTIF) orders.  GO is the newest Nulogy product which is being developed for CPG brands to help them improve their order execution. GO is the newest Nulogy product which is being developed for CPG brands to help them improve their order execution. All suppliers and co-packers are measured compared to a target timeline set by the CPG brand. Real time order tracking involves the management of in progress orders. This section did not previously exist in GO and I worked to design this experience for CPG Brands.

                  Worked closely with the other Designer to use different design methodologies in order to develop personas, and create mock-ups and wireframes for the GO team. Presented ideas for feedback at weekly Product Design Meetings.

                    Helped plan and run a <a href = " http://www.gv.com/sprint/">Google Ventures Design Sprint</a>. I helped recruit team members for the design sprint as well as the user testing participants. Participated in the sprint itself as a designer. Created mockups and collaborated with other participants using Sketch symbols and Craft library. Used in Vision for the final prototype. Organized user interviews to test the prototype. Helped consolidate notes to create a final presentation about the outcomes from the Design Sprint as well as next steps.

                Requirements were gathered based on existing user Visited client site to shadow and understand how they worked with their current system and how GO would help make their days easier. Used tools such as user journey mapping to understand the most stressful parts of their day. Also asked clients to complete tasks using a prototype to understand which features need to be prioritized over others.

                The original information architecture needed to be redesigned as new functionality was added to the site. Card sorting activities were carried out with potential users to ensure that the new information architecture would make sense to the end user. The card sorting was also used to confirm and refine industry terminology.  Test participants were given a stack of cards with terms on them and asked to group them as they saw fit. They were then asked to title the existing groups. Participants were also given blank cards and markers to add any terms they thought were missing. This activity was very useful for understanding the current processes in the industry as well as to confirm terminology.
